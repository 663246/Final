<p style="text-align:center">
I am currently a sophomore majoring in Sociology at   <a href="https://vanguard.edu" target="_blank">  Vanguard University.</a>
    <br>
I am looking for an internship within the areas of social work and community development.  <br>
I am still unsure of what exact career path I wish to take, but I am very happy I chose Sociology. <br>
Prior to Sociology, I was going to major in Art History. It was a difficult decision, but I have been doing great so far. <br>
Although I felt regret, I am trying my best to think like a sociologist. <br>
Besides learning, I'm in the process of discovering my skills and talents. <br>
Despite my uncertainty, I want to be the best at my work, and I want to be happy with my job. That is really all I want from a job. <br>
And I am very happy about the place I am at now. <br>
